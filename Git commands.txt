Git Commands For first time checkin:
 First create repository in github where you want to commit the code
 Now got to the location in local from where you want to commit the code to Git :  /c/rahul/study/udemy/java-8/project/demo
 Make sure with ls command this will give the folder where you are 
  git init
 Then copy https link of the repository from github. run below command with https link
  git remote add origin https://github.com/rahul-x-saxena/udemyjava.git
 Check if you are allowed for push pull
  git remote -v
 If you want to commit all the files then we will
  git add .
  git commit -m "Udemy java8 project"
 If you are doing commit for the first time then you will land up with some error like who you are
		 *** Please tell me who you are.

		Run

		  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
		  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

		to set your account's default identity.
		Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

		fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'RAHUL SAXENA@RAHULSAXENA-HP.(none)')
 Now you will have to run 2 commands to give the identity
  git config --global user.email "rahul.x.saxena@gmail.com"
  git config --local user.name "rahul-x-saxena"
 To confirm that your username and emailId is reflecting please run below command
  git config --list
 With this you should be able to see your username and emailId
 Again go ahead with 
  git commit -m "demo commit"
 Check your commit is successful or not, for that you should be able to see your git commit message in ref logs
  git reflog
 To push the changes 
   git push origin master
   Here you might be asked for username and password popup. So we will have to give username and password there
   once authentication is done you will see your changes are committed and pushed in master branch
